description: "Some of my favorite kitchen tools and food resources"
---

For tools and ingredients, Iâ€™ve included links to what I am currently using
whenever possible. Some things either seem not to exist where I thought they
did, or just no longer exist in the same way.

Everything is listed in the order it came to my mind, not necessary ranked by
importance or preference.

Book links are most often [Bookshop](https://bookshop.org/). No affiliation, I
just like them.

## Kitchen Tools -- Some tools I think are pretty darn essential:

-   [Instant Read Thermometer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XDHT39G/)
-   [Kitchen Scale](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CH9OCG/)

    The one here is metal, but plastic ones are also very useful.
