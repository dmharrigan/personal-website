Though I currently call New York City my home, I was born and raised in a shore
town in South Jersey. Consequently, I believe flip flops are acceptable
year-round footwear and I am most comfortable when there is a beach within a
mile of my location. I don't even really _like_ the beach (sand is gross), it's
just nice to know it's there.

I really enjoy cooking and baking, especially baking bread. When I’m not making
a mess of my kitchen I’m cuddling my cat, reading, and occasionally traveling.
