Building upon the CSS I learned to customize the initial iteration of my blog on
WordPress, I wanted to familiarize myself with Bootstrap and its uses, so I made
this personal website.

After learning Hugo for my blog, I applied that knowledge to updating this site,
to make adding projects and other items in the future even easier and more
organized.
