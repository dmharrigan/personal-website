Part cooking, part research, part writing: the blog was a place that combined
many of my interests. This site was initially created in Wordpress when I had no
web design experience. I later learned how to use the static site generator,
Hugo, to make building and adding to the blog even easier.

I no longer post recipe updates, as I've found food blogging isn't really my
thing, but i'm still proud of the work I put in to creating it, and I enjoy
comparing my progress as I move on to newer projects.
