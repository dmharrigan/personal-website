I sort of fell of the cooking/baking and blogging wagon recently. I was
initially hoping to use all the time I wasn’t commuting and working (since my
schedule has reduced slightly) to get a bunch of kitchen projects out of the
way. Instead I’ve mostly been staring at the computer or TV (Yay animal
crossing!).

I’m going to start what I hope will be consistent posting with a list of
projects I’ve got in the works, and maybe these projects will become posts of
their own.

## Here’s what I’m working on when the mood moves me\*:

-   Bagels- plain for the hubs, everything for me
-   Cast iron pan pizza
-   Crepes- regular flour, and buckwheat flour, sweet and/or savory
-   Focaccia
-   Lasagna
-   My perfect chicken recipe
-   Tamagoyaki- My tamagoyaki pan arrived a few days ago, and I’ve yet to try it
    out, but I’m very excited to perfect this skill soon.

## Things I'm **not** working on:

-   Ricotta cheese cookies- this project is going to have to wait until I can
    feed people besides myself and the hubs. There’s only so many sweet things
    we can eat, as we learned with item #2…
-   Brownies- I tried Alton Brown’s brownie recipe, and while it was really
    good, I’d like to play with it a little, once I can share with other people
    and not have a tray of uber-rich brownies all to myself (I know, a dream to
    some, a nightmare to others).
-   “Sunday Gravy”- (Can I call it Sunday Gravy as a non Italian-American?) I’ve
    made this once before, and it makes so much food. Once we’re able to gather
    again, I’m having everyone over for dinner, and this is on the menu.

\*The mood has moved me precisely 3 times in the last two weeks. The first two
days I started working from home, and today, when I made three different things
for the first time (all of them **not** failures, woo!). Here’s hoping for more
fruitful days in the kitchen soon.
