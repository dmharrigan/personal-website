This is not a recipe post. There was basically no research, and certainly not
testing or development, that went into the best pan pizza I’ve ever made…

Inspired by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt’s
[“POV Foolproof No Knead Pan Pizza” video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HukqEjCPkhU&t=455s),
I decided to tackle my own pan pizza. Turns out, there is no “Dana’s take” on
this recipe. There is nothing I’d change, the ratios and guidelines result in
fantastic pizza.

I followed the ratios given in the video, not the recipe linked in the
description, and it was perfect. My pizza dough sat on the counter for about 22
hours total. I folded at 14 hours and 20 hours, then put the dough in the pan to
rest for 2 hours before shaping, topping and baking. I used the ingredient
amounts given in the video and found that it just about filled my 12-inch cast
iron pan, while allowing enough room around the edge for crispy cheese. Because
you’re given percent hydration, salt, and yeast, I think it makes it easy to
scale up or down.

I did bake mine at a slightly lower temp cause I’m always afraid of setting my
apartment’s sensitive smoke alarm off, but the results were still wonderful.

Is this post kind of a cop out and not really a recipe? Yes. Am I sorry? No. The
void deserves to know how much I love this pizza.
