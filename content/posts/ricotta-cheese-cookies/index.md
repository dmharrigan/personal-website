# Mom's Recipe (obtained from who knows where at this point, she's been making these forever):

## Ingredients

### Cookies

-   1/2 lb margarine, room temperature (_yes, you read that right: margarine_).
-   2 cups sugar
-   2 eggs
-   1 lb ricotta cheese
-   2 tsp vanilla extract
-   4 cups flour
-   1 tsp baking soda
-   1 tsp baking powder

### Icing

-   Icing Sugar – maybe a cup? There’s no measurement in the recipe I was given,
    you just eye ball that shit and hope for the best
-   Milk- again, no measurement- video below for consistency
-   Colored sugar to top (_Mom uses red & green sugar, since she only makes
    these cookies for Christmas_).

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F.

2. In a stand mixer with paddle attachment- cream together the room temperature
   margarine and sugar.

3. Add eggs, ricotta, vanilla, baking soda, baking powder, and mix adding the
   flour cup by cup.

4. Use two table spoons to scoop the cookies on to an unlined, clean baking
   sheet. There should be a heaping 2 tablespoons worth of dough for each
   cookie. They spread a little, so give them a couple inches between each on
   the pan. There is no need to grease the sheet, the cookies will release on
   their own.

5. Bake for 15 minutes. Both of our ovens bake these cookies in 15 minutes, but
   apparently the original recipe calls for 8-10 minutes, so you’re gonna have
   to experiment a little. You’re looking for a non-wobbly, set cookie, with a
   toasty brown bottom, lightly browned bits on top, but still mostly pale.

6. While the cookies bake, mix the icing. Start with a cup of icing sugar in a
   bowl, and put a table spoon or so of milk in at a time, until you have a
   slightly thick, yet pour-able mixture. _Mom and I argue about the icing every
   time we bake these together, I like it slightly thinner, she likes it
   thicker._

7. When the cookies are baked, transfer them immediately to cooling racks that
   are set up over parchment paper, wax paper, or something else protecting your
   counter top from icing drips.

8. Spoon the icing over the warm cookies and sprinkle with colored sugar. I find
   icing three or four cookies at a time and then sprinkling them with sugar
   before moving on to the rest works best. Otherwise the icing will set and the
   sugar won’t stick.
9. If you make these small, like 2 tablespoons of dough or less per cookie, you
   can get about 5 dozen out of this recipe. I do tend to make mine larger,
   which also extends the bake time by a minute or two.

## Notes

### What I'm changing...

Much to my mother’s chagrin, I have been using butter instead of margarine in
these cookies. When she she first gave me the recipe, she insisted on margarine,
and said the recipe doesn’t work if you use butter, “believe me I’ve tried.” And
technically, you don’t get the same cookie when you use butter, but I posit that
you get a _better_ cookie when you use butter. The dough is less smooth, and
results in an airier scone/cookie hybrid thing. It has thus-far been much loved
by my taste-testers (aka pretty much anyone in my office that I can talk in to
trying a cookie post holiday). I’ve tested salted vs. unsalted butter so far,
and honestly, there wasn’t much of a difference. Sometimes I find these too
sweet, so I think I was hoping the salted butter would combat that. My husband
made the very valid point that not all salted butter is salted the same amount,
so I’m better off choosing an amount of salt to add to the dough and starting
with unsalted butter. (Spoiler alert- that’s the next test).

Important thing to remember when it comes to butter- let that shit get **proper
room temperature soft**. Don’t be impatient, don’t think “oh it’s a bit firm but
I bet it will work.” If the butter isn’t room temp and rather soft, it will not
cream properly with the sugar, and it will not incorporate properly in the rest
of the dough. Then you’ll end up with chunks of butter that melt out of your
cookie and fuck up the texture. I know this, I’ve read about this, I’ve seen
pictures of when people do this, and in my haste to test and move on, I made
this damn mistake. I ended up with a set of cookies that had weird melted
butter/sugar crystallization on the outside, and were overly crumbly since the
mix didn’t really hold together.

### Whats to Come

-   Using unsalted butter in the dough, adding a bit of salt to the sugar
    topping
-   Unsalted butter + teaspoon of salt (to start) in the dough
-   Flavors!
    -   Orange and cardamom
    -   Lemon (and some kind of herb?)
    -   Cinnamon (and maybe other warm spices?)
