I was a bit of a zombie for several months this year, owing mostly to the
pandemic bringing life as we knew it to a halt. Cooking and thinking about what
to make, how to improve something, or make something new, was a huge mental feat
that was just not happening. But the hubs and I still had to eat…

Thankfully, we have a small repertoire of meals that can be thrown together with
absolutely no thought, and that we always have the components for in our pantry.
Whenever we go to the grocery store, we check our supply of pre-made beef gravy,
Francesco Rinaldi original pasta sauce, Cambell’s Cream of Chicken Soup and
pasta, noodles, and rice.

We ran out of rice at the beginning of April and I was in a low-level state of
distress until we restocked. When I truly cannot be bothered, or haven’t the
slightest motivation to even order take out, a bowl of rice, or rice porridge,
goes a long way in filling me up and holding me over until motivation finds me
again.

Here’s what we eat on regular rotation, especially when the food mood isn’t
moving me:

-   General combo 1: protein + starch (often pasta) + pre-made sauce + sometimes
    vegetables
    -   Chicken breast + cream of chicken soup + milk + cavatappi or other
        spiral-y pasta (if one were so inclined, they could add peppers,
        tomatoes, mushrooms, peas, or any number of vegetables to this to make a
        more nutritionally well-rounded meal)
    -   Sweet Italian sausage + pre-made pasta sauce + rigatoni (I like to add a
        little wilted kale. Hubs does not like kale)
    -   Steak + gravy (pre-made) + rice (again, any number of vegetables could
        be added, if you were so inclined)
-   General combo 2: Seared or pan fried protein (steak, chicken, or pork
    chops) + starch (noodles, pasta, or rice)+ freezer vegetables (corn is the
    only vegetable we agree on the way it should be cooked, so that gets made a
    lot)
-   Half-assed tacos (ground beef + pre-made taco seasoning + store bought flour
    tortillas). When I think ahead a little bit I like bell peppers, tomatoes,
    and lettuce added to mine.

The general take away I get from looking at our default meals is that they are
very simple, and we really need to eat more damn vegetables. I also don’t have
many notes above on seasoning, partly because I think it can be pretty
versatile. Season as you like, liberally, and add more vegetables. Freezer
vegetables are your friend.

Now that I’m back to feeling like a functioning human, I dove back into the
kitchen pretty hardcore a couple weekends ago. Here’s a sample of the projects I
started or continued:

-   Herb-y crepes
-   Sauteed mushrooms three ways (for crepe filling/topping)
-   Overnight no knead bread (w/ thyme and olive oil)
-   Blueberry spoon cake (adapted from the
    [NYTimes Cooking Strawberry Spoon Cake](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021174-strawberry-spoon-cake))
-   Fresh pasta

I also had it in my mind I was going to make a pavlova, on the same day I made
bread, spoon cake, and fresh pasta, but that didn’t happen, as the pasta took up
a nice chunk of time. I always forget how long it takes to roll out pasta, even
with the neat stand mixer attachment.

Now that I’m back in the groove of cooking for fun, I’m going to revisit bagels,
crepes, and focaccia. And after putting our standard dinners into writing, it is
pretty obvious they need some help to become truly well-rounded meals, so that
is probably a project worth tackling as well.

Stay tuned!
