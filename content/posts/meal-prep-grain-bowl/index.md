## Method

### Quinoa (Grain Bowl Base)

1. Cook the rinsed quinoa according to package directions. (The kind I used was
   1 cup dry quinoa to 2 cups water. Bring to boil, reduce to simmer, cover &
   cook for 15 minutes).
2. Fluff the quinoa with a fork and then mix in the tahini, water, and lemon
   juice.
    - You can add more water or lemon juice to make this initial mixture less of
      a sticky quinoa lump (appetizing description, I know), but I add a splash
      of water when I reheat day of, so I find it being a bit thick at this
      stage is fine.
3. I measure my quinoa into half up portions for my lunch prep and refrigerate.

### Basic Massaged Kale

1. Destem, wash & dry kale as you normally would
2. Place kale in a bowl, squeeze ½ a lemon over top, sprinkle on a couple
   pinches of salt, and basically scrunch the kale in your hands, mixing the
   lemon juice and salt through all the kale as you go.
3. Massage until the kale seems slightly wilted or broken down, pack away in the
   fridge.
    - I tend to pack the kale in one or two containers, and just grab a handful
      during assembly.

### Roasted Zucchini

1. Preheat the oven to 350 °F.
2. Wash and dry the zucchini. Slice in half lengthwise and place on a baking
   sheet (I like to line mine with aluminum foil to make clean up easier later).
3. Drizzle zucchini with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and toss to
   evenly coat.
4. Roast for 20-30 minutes depending on the size of your zucchini, flipping over
   halfway through.
5. Once cooled enough to handle, cut into ½ inch pieces, portion for each day,
   and refrigerate. Or, refrigerate all in one container and portion out day of,
   whatever works best for you and your fridge space (or your office’s fridge
   space).

### Sesame Marinated Tofu

1. Press the tofu block between two plates with some weight on top. Since this
   may take a couple hours at least, you’ll want to put the tofu back in the
   fridge.
2. Once the tofu has released the amount of water you want it to (or you get
   tired of waiting), cut into cubes.
3. Mix lemon juice, sesame oil, chicken stock, and red pepper flakes in a bowl.
4. Place the tofu in the marinade bowl, toss to coat, and stick it in the fridge
   for at least2 hours, but up to overnight.
5. Once your tofu has marinated, preheat the oven to 350 °F.
6. Put the tofu on a foil lined baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle
   with salt and pepper, and toss a bit to evenly coat.
7. Bake for 40-50 minutes, flipping the tofu after about 20 minutes of cooking.
8. Cool and refrigerate.

### "Dressing" (a.k.a Thinned out tahini)

Mix 1 tbsp tahini with lemon juice and water until it reaches a pourable
consistency. My tahini was super thick and required a lot of mixing and tasting,
and mixing and tasting, and mixing and tasting, until I got a texture that I
liked. The lemon juice helps cut the intense sesame flavor and stickiness, and
the water helps thin out the whole mixture without adding any additional flavor.

### Day of Assembly

1. In a microwave safe bowl, reheat your pre-portioned quinoa, with a splash of
   water if necessary. I like to start with 30 seconds in the microwave, stir,
   and then give it another 15-30 seconds, depending on the microwave. If you’re
   feeling fancy, transfer the quinoa to a pretty bowl (or maybe whatever large
   enough vessel you find in the office cabinet, _ahem_ guilty)
2. On a microwave safe plate (or in the same microwave safe bowl you used to
   reheat your quinoa), heat the tofu and zucchini. Again, I like to start with
   30 seconds and assess how well the microwave has done its job.
3. Place kale, tofu, zucchini, hard boiled eggs, avocados, tomatoes, sesame
   seeds, and whatever other miscellaneous toppings you like on top of the
   quinoa, and drizzle with your tahini “dressing”. Enjoy!

## Notes

I debated with myself as to whether or not I was going to put this up as my
first recipe post for some time, because it seemed like something so simple, and
so much of it isn’t really “cooking” per-se. But, two parts of my brain won in
the end: the part screaming “if you don’t put this out into the void, what are
you going to put out there?!” and the part that was like “this is such a tasty
lunch your lazy butt made and consumed it for two weeks straight, so it must be
worthy of sharing with someone.” So void, here we are. Recipe #1- Crazy Easy
Sesame Centric Grain Bowl…

I have been prepping and packing my lunch consistently since May 2019, when I
started a new job that is a 30 minute commute from my home. Some weeks I look
forward to lunch every day and some weeks by day 2 or 3 I’m cursing my own name.
If I’m going to eat the same thing for lunch for 5 days in a row, and not be
bored out of my mind, it has to be tasty (extra points for visually pleasing).

The inspiration for this recipe came through casual conversation with my friend
Rebekah about the benefits of quinoa (it’s a complete protein, it is a source of
fiber, etc.). We’re both looking for foods that are filling and nutritious, and
we like throwing recipe ideas back and forth. I was also super jealous of the
lunches she was making that featured tahini dressing.

This whole thing pretty much came together in one shot. Like I mentioned, it’s
pretty damn simple. Just lots of individual pieces coming together to make
something tasty. For the tofu, my first attempt saw me trying to marinate the
tofu in tahini, water, and lemon juice (you’re probably sensing a theme by now-
right?) with grated garlic. While the tahini resulted in an interesting exterior
texture in the end, it did not penetrate the tofu enough to really leave any
flavor on the inside. This meant my tofu had a tasty crispy outside, and
basically no flavor inside. Since tahini is made from sesame seeds, i figured
sesame oil would give me a similar flavor, and I kept the lemon juice. I needed
something to bulk up the amount of marinade, but didn’t want it to be overly
tart by adding more lemon juice, so I added some chicken stock I had in the
fridge. You can totally use vegetable stock instead- just be sure to use a
liquid that is adding volume and flavor.

I feel like the kale preparation part hardly constitutes a “recipe” but it is an
absolutely necessary step, and is entirely thanks to my friend Rebekah, who
recommended I massage kale to help make it more manageable to eat raw. My first
round of this bowl also had a red cabbage sesame slaw, which may find its way
onto the blog at some point, but was omitted from the final version of the bowl,
since the crunchy greens/veggie roll was filled sufficiently by the massaged
kale.

You could totally add more flavors to the roasted zucchini, but both days I made
zucchini I was feeling super lazy. I’ll probably add it to the to-do list of
things to develop further.

Something to think about/keep in mind…

**RINSE YOUR QUINOA**- I cannot say this enough: rinse that shit. I thought I
hated quinoa until the first time I rinsed it before cooking. Rising it removes
the coating which can, for lack of a better term, make it **gross** when it
cooks. I have been giving the “pre-rinsed” stuff a quick run under the tap as
well. I will never go back to sad quinoa. I also find that quinoa freezes really
well- 1 dry cup of quinoa results in about 3 cups cooked, and I tend to prep for
4-5 days max, so a serving or two usually ends up in the freezer for later use.

How I like my hard boiled eggs:

I bring the water to a boil, put the eggs in, and set a timer for 8 minutes. I
like a golden yolk that isn’t too crumbly. When the timer dings, I run them
under cold water and put them in the fridge, or put them in an ice bath if I’m
trying to eat them or further prepare them right away.
