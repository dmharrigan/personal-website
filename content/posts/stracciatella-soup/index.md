## Ingredients

-   3 cups stock, plus 3-4 tbsp (I’ve made with both chicken and turkey stock.
    Both are delicious)
-   1 cup water
-   4 eggs
-   2 cloves garlic, grated or finely minced, divided in half (or 2 tbsp
    pre-minced garlic, the kind you find in a jar)
-   1/4 to 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese, more for topping
-   1/2 cup dry orzo pasta
-   1/2 tbsp olive oil handful of clean broccoli rabe stems and leaves cut or
    broken into 1/3s or 1/2s
-   1/4 of whole lemon
-   salt
-   pepper

## Method

1. Bring 3 cups chicken stock and 1 cup water to a boil.
2. While the stock and water are coming to a boil, whisk together eggs, 3-4 tbsp
   stock, 1 clove (or 1 tbsp) garlic, grated parm, and salt and pepper.
    1. How much parm you add here will depend on personal preference. I find
       somewhere between 1/4 to 1/3 cup gets me the flavor and texture I like–
       fluffy and cheesy.
    2. You could leave the pepper out and just use a bit of salt here, but I
       really enjoy the pepper, it adds a nice bite.
3. Once the stock & water have come to a boil, whisk in the egg mixture. Once
   that has been whisked in, if you’d like larger egg pieces at the end, i would
   recommend swapping to a spoon for stirring at this point, otherwise you can
   pretty much stick with the whisk until the end.
4. Let the stock & eggs come back to a boil, add the orzo, and cook according to
   the orzo’s package directions for al dente. Stir occasionally to ensure the
   orzo isn’t sticking to the bottom of the pot. You can reduce the heat
   slightly here if needed, you don’t necessarily need a raging boil, but you
   don’t want it as low as a simmer.
5. While the orzo cooks, bring a separate pot of water to a boil, and prepare a
   pan with 1/2 tbsp of olive oil, and the remaining garlic.
6. Once the water is boiling, add some salt, drop in the broccoli rabe to blanch
   for no more than a minute. When you drop the broccoli rabe, turn on the pan
   with olive oil and garlic to medium heat.
7. Put the blanched broccoli rabe into the heated sauté pan and cook until
   tender, just a couple minutes.
8. Remove the broccoli rabe from the heat, and drizzle with the juice of up to
   1/4 a lemon. You can do less if you want a less strong lemon flavor. 1/4 of a
   lemon will give you a pretty strong hit of sour.
9. Finish with salt and pepper to taste.
10. Once the orzo has cooked, the soup is ready, just add salt & pepper to
    taste. Plate up in a bowl and top with the sautéed broccoli rabe, and
    additional Parmesan cheese if desired.

## Notes

The first time I tried making this based on an amalgamation of recipes I found
online. It didn’t have enough eggs for my liking, and I had wilted spinach in at
the end. I will still occasionally add spinach when I make this, but the
broccoli rabe has more texture, and the bitter, lemony, garlicy, flavor
compliments the rest of the soup. The final egg to liquid ratio of 1 egg for
every 1 cup of liquid results in exactly what I wanted- lots of egg, just enough
broth to count as a soup.

I’ve tried making this with the pre-grated parm you can find in containers at
the grocery store and learned that was not a good idea – it didn’t melt into the
eggs or the broth, and was oddly stringy. I get the wedge of parm and grate as
needed.

Here is the soup sans anything green- not as pretty, but still totally
satisfying and comforting:

While I was playing around with my egg to broth ratio, I decided to put green
things on the back burner and just focus on the basic soup. And if I’m tired,
sick, or just not feeling it, I can throw this together by eye-balling it, and
have home made comfort food in 15 to 20 minutes, with low effort.

If you are a garlic lover like me, you could up the garlic, and if you are not a
fan, you can cut it out entirely. The recipe above is what I find to be the
happy medium of garlic flavor.

This recipe probably makes about 4 small (or 2 large) servings of soup and 2
servings of broccoli rabe. The orzo will absorb some broth as it sits, so more
water and/or chicken stock may be needed for reheats. I would suggest storing
the soup and making the broccoli rabe from fresh each time.
